				This poem, "arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American," was first published anonymously
				in the
				Troy, New York Sentinel on December 23, 1823. It had been given to the paper's editor by Sarah Sackett
				of Troy,
				who probably got it from Harriet Butler of Troy, a family friend of the Moores.

				Anonymous or pseudonymous publication of poetry was customary at the time, but as the poem's popularity
				grew so
				did curiosity about its author. In response to a query in 1829, Sentinel editor Orville Holley wrote
				that "We
				have been given to understand that the author ... belongs by birth and residence to the city of New
				York, and
				that he is a gentleman of more merit as a scholar and a writer than many of more noisy pretensions."
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1837 Moore was finally publicly identified as the author in journalist Charles Fenno Hoffman's The
				New-York
				Book of Poetry, to which Moore had submitted several poems. In 1844, he included "Visit" in Poems, an
				anthology
				of his works. His children, for whom he had originally written the piece, encouraged this publication.
				In 1855,
				Mary C. Moore Ogden, one of the Moores' married daughters, painted "illuminations" to go with the first
				color
				edition of the poem.
