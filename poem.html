                <div>Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house</div>
                <div>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.</div>
                <div>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</div>
                <div>In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,</div>
                <div>While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.</div>
                <div>And mamma in her ‘kerchief, and I in my cap,</div>
                <div>Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap.</div>

                <div>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</div>
                <div>I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.</div>
                <div>Away to the window I flew like a flash,</div>
                <div>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow</div>
                <div>Gave lustre of mid-day to objects below.</div>
                <div>When, what to my wondering eyes did appear,</div>
                <div>But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,</div>
                <div>I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.</div>
                <div>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,</div>
                <div>And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>"Now Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!</div>
                <div>On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donder and Blitzen!</div>
                <div>To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!</div>
                <div>Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,</div>
                <div>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.</div>
                <div>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,</div>
                <div>With the sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.</div>

            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof</div>
                <div>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</div>
                <div>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,</div>
                <div>Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,</div>
                <div>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.</div>
                <div>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</div>
                <div>And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>His eyes -- how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!</div>
                <div>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!</div>
                <div>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</div>
                <div>And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</div>
                <div>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.</div>
                <div>He had a broad face and a little round belly,</div>
                <div>That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!</div>
                <div>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,</div>
                <div>And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!</div>
                <div>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,</div>
                <div>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">
                <div>He spoke not a word, and went straight to his work,</div>
                <div>Filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.</div>
                <div>And laying his finger aside of his nose,</div>
                <div>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!</div>
            </div>
            <div class="poem-line">

                <div>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,</div>
                <div>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.</div>
                <div>But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,</div>
                <div>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"</div>
